  title: Shipnow API
  description: |
    ShipNow exposes it's information using RESTful interface. Detailed
    documentation of every endpoint is available below.

    Requests
    --------

     * Our production API is hosted at https://api.shipnow.com.ar. If you want to 
    try it, feel free to create a test user directly.

    If you need to test your clients, feel free to pollute the testing API with
    test data, though keep in mind that it will be cleared every few hours.

    On occasions, testing may diverge slightly from production. This should not
    last long, since we generally deploy to one and quickly to the other. If you
    find such discrepancies, don't worry, since they should quickly propagate to
    production.

    Both APIs use HTTPS (ie: HTTP + TLS) exclusively. You MUST NOT attempt to reach
    them using raw HTTP.

    ### Authentication

    Authentication is not yet done via OAuth, but a simpler password-based
    mechanism.

    Users will provide their username and password, which you will then exchange
    for a `Token` by `POST`ing to `/users/authentication`, using HTTP Basic
    Authentication (as defined in [rfc2617][rfc2617]). This will return the entire
    user object, which contains the user's token:

        {
            "id": 1,
            "email": "hugo@barrera.io",
            "token": "1234abcDEFGHIJkmnlopQRsT0uv1WxyZABcdEF2gH34IjkmNO5",
            "type": "human",
            "description": "Hugo",
            "role": "admin",
            "account": {},
            "avatar_url": null
        }

    This token should be included in every request header to operate on behalf of
    the user, inside the `Authorization` header, as follows:

        Token token=1234abcDEFGHIJkmnlopQRsT0uv1WxyZABcdEF2gH34IjkmNO5

    You SHOULD NOT store user's username or password. You should only store the
    provided token.

    Responses
    ---------

    ### Data

    All data is sent and received using [JSON][json]. Request data will be
    contained inside a `results` object:

        {
            "results": [
               {
                  "id": 1,
                  "name": "sample object 1",
                  "created_at": "2017-12-14T15:42:12.898Z"
               }
            ]
        }

    All models also contain `updated_at` and `created_at` fields (these are
    ommited from most examples for readability). They are the last-update and
    creation times respectively  and cannot be manually edited.

    ### Errors

    In case of a 4XX (except 422) or 5XX status code, errors MAY be included in
    an errors array:

        {
            "errors": [
                "Access Denied"
            ]
        }

    In case of a 422 status code, validation errors will be included in an
    errors object:

        {
            errors: {
                "someField": "Description of someField's error",
                "anotherField": "Cannot be blank"
            }
        }

    We adhere quite closely to [HTTP 1.1][http1.1], with one exception: When data
    validation fails, we will return a 422 status code.

    All dates are use the [ISO8601][iso8601] format, and are UTC-time, unless
    otherwise specified.

    ### Pagination

    By default, all endpoints will return at most the first twenty elements
    inside the `results` array. To obtain other elements include the `page`
    query parameter, eg:

        https://api.shipnow.com.ar/orders?page=2

    The link to the next and last pages can be found in the `Link` HTTP header:

        <https://api-staging.shipnow.com.ar/orders?page=20>; rel="last", <https://api-staging.shipnow.com.ar/orders?page=2>; rel="next"

    Page indexes are one-based, meaning that the first pages is one, and NOT
    zero.

    Accounts vs Users
    -----------------

    Each client has a single account, which in turn, has multiple users. An account
    will hold all orders and variants for that client, which all users of that
    account can access (with different roles).

    Each account can have as many users as they need.  Additional users can be
    created via the API or the sellers interface.

    Roles and permissions
    ---------------------

    Users can have one of two roles:
     * Manager: These are the top-level users for each account, and can
       create other users, as well as a few more special actions.
     * Regular: These are the lower-level users, which can create/edit orders,
       variants, and use other day-to-day interfaces.

    Bots, or automated automated integrations interacting with the API should
    generally have their own user. It's recommended that their role is set
    to `regular` and its permissions are as limited as possible.

    Stores
    ------

    Each account can have multiple stores. Stores represent different points of
    sales (eg: MercadoLibre, TiendaNube, eBay, retail, etc).

    If you link shipnow to one of our integrated stores via the web ui, a new
    store will be created for each one. The `store_type` field should help
    reveal which integration that is.

    A single account may also have more than one store for the same store type
    (eg: a single account can be linked to two MercadoLibre profiles).

    If your intention is to read order data from ShipNow, you generally won't
    pay much attention to stores. If your intention is to create orders, you'll
    probably want to use the store type "custom".

    You can create as many stores as you need, and it's strongly recommended
    that you use one per application you're integrating, or per point of sales.

    Order Statuses
    --------------

    Each order has a status indicating at which point in the delivery process
    it's currently in. Below is a brief summary of each status, and which
    transitions sellers may perform for each one.

    Be careful not to confuse `status` with `state`. The latter refers to the
    geopolitical subdivision, not to an order's state.

    ### awaiting_payment
    Indicates that the seller has not yet confirmed that it has been paid. 
    Orders in this status will not be process, and will remain unaltered 
    until the status is updated.

    Valid transitions: `new`, `on_hold`, `cancelled`

    ### new
    This is the initial status for all paid orders. Orders in this status are ready to be allocated. This status should be temporary. If we have stock for all their items, it will be updated automatically to `ready_to_pick`. If not, the order will be paused (`on_hold`).

    Valid transitions: `ready_to_pick`, `on_hold`

    ### ready_to_pick
    Orders with this status are allocated and awaiting to be picked from the warehouse.

    Valid transitions: `picking_list`, `on_hold`

    ### picking_list
    Items for this order and in the process of being gathered around the
    warehouse.

    Valid transitions: `packing_slip`

    ### packing_slip
    Items for this order are being packaged and labeled for delivery.

    Valid transitions: `ready_to_ship`

    ### ready_to_ship
    The package for this order is ready, and is awaiting delivery by the
    courier.

    Valid transitions: `shipped`, `delivered`, `on_hold`

    ### shipped
    The package has been picked up by the courier and is en route to its final
    destination.

    Valid transitions: `delivered`, `not_delivered`

    ### delivered
    The package has been delivered to the buyer successfully. Orders in this
    status may not transition to other statuses.

    ### not_delivered
    Delivery of the package failed (eg: inexistant address, rejected, etc).
    Orders in this status may not transition to other statuses.

    ### on_hold
    The order has been paused, and no further processing will occur
    until it transitions out of this state. If a package exists for an order in
    this state, it will be located and set aside.

    When an order transititions into this state, manual intervention MAY be
    required, and, in some cases, it may not be possible to action the request
    (eg: a package may be given to the courier just as the request comes in,
    etc).

    Valid transitions: `new`, `cancelled`

    ### cancelled
    The order has been cancelled, and will no longer be processed. Orders in
    this status may not transition to other statuses.

    Updating orders
    ---------------

    Depending on an order's status, some fields may not be editable, eg:it's
    impossible to change the destination address for a package that's already
    been shipped.

    The `store_id` field cannot be edited and is considered readonly after an
    order creation.

    Keep in mind that you can set an order's status to `on_hold` (unless it has
    been shipped) if there's an exceptional scenario that requires edition of
    otherwise non-editable fields.

    The following is a brief overview of which fields can be edited for orders
    in each status:

    `awaiting_payment`, `ready_to_pick` or `on_hold`:
    All fields may be edited.

    `picking_list`:
    The `items` field can no longer be edited at this point. All other fields
    are still editable.

    `packing_slip`, `ready_to_ship`, `shipped`, `delivered` `not_delivered` or `cancelled`:
    Only the `comments` field is editable at this point.

    Shipping Services
    -----------------

    Shipnow works with several carriers that offer several shipping services.
    Generally, if you don't specify a carrier/service for an order, we will
    automatically select the best choice for new.

    That said, if you need to work with a specific service/carrier, you may
    select one. Each shipping service has a `type` field which indicates what
    type of service this is. These are described below.

    Keep in mind that when specifying a post office (either as source or
    destination), you do not need to specify an address; we'll automatically
    fill that in.

    ### ship_pas

    Door to PostOffice shipments. These require a valid origin address and a
    valid destination `post_office_id`.

    ### ship_sap

    PostOffice to Door shipments. These require a valid destination address and
    a valid origin `post_office_id`.

    ### pickup

    This isn't an actualy shipping service; just the packaging. Clients will
    pick up the order (either at shipnow, or somewhere else, depending on the
    specific service).

    ### ship_pap

    Door to Door shipments. These require both valid origin and destination
    addresses.

    ### ship_sas

    Post Office to Post Office shipments. These require both a valid origin and
    destination `post_office_id`.

    ### marketplace

    These shipping services are specific to a certain marketplace, and should
    not be used explicitly.
    
    Shipping Pricing
    -----------------
    The shipping price of an order will depend on the account id,
    the zip_code to where the order is sent, and its total weight.
    
    ### Pre-calculate price
    If you want to know an approximate price before creating an order, you can make a `GET` request to 
    `/shipping_options?weight={weight}&to_zip_code={zip_code}&types={types}`
    specifying the total weight of the order the zip code where it will be send to and the type of the shipping
    being `ship_pap`, `ship_pas` or both (separate by a comma in that case `ship_pap,ship_pas`)
    
    The response has in the result field a list with the three closest branches of each post office that ships to that zip code. 

    Every element of the list has the following attributes:
    * `minimum_delivery` (string datetime)
    * `maximum_delivery` (string datetime)
    * `price` (float) The pre-calculated price
    * `ship_from_type` (string) ('Account', DeliveryZone', PostOffice' or 'Warehouse')
    * `ship_from` (object) May be anyone of the four types
    * `ship_to_type` (string) ('Account', DeliveryZone', PostOffice' or 'Warehouse')
    * `ship_to` (object) May be anyone of the four types
    * `shipping_contract` (object) The contract generated to this shipping
    * `shipping_service` (object) The service of this shipping
          
    Post Offices
    ------------
    
    As Shipnow works with differents carriers, some of them provide us the possibility 
    of using their post offices so clients can picking up their package.
     Shipnow can deliver orders to Oca, Garbarino and Andreani post offices.

    Webhooks
    --------

    You can receive notifications in your app when certain event occur.

    Notifications are delivered via webhooks, which are created by POSTing to
    the /webhooks endpoint documented below.

    Webhook notifications will be delivered by `POST`ing data about the event
    with the following format:

        {
          "action": "create",
          "topic": "orders/create",
          "resource_id": 1,
          "resource_type": "orders"
        }

     * `action` is the action for which this notification applies. It can be either `create`, `update` or `destroy`.
     * `topic` describes the event, and is composed of `resource_type/action`.
     * `resource_id` is the `id` of the model which fired this notification
       (eg: the id of the order that has been created).
     * `resource_type` is the `type` of the model which fired this notification
       (eg: the id of the `orders/create` that has been `orders`).

    Transfers
    ---------

    It allows to transfer variants and orders between two deposits. When creating a transfer, it must be specified a minimum and maximum timetable in which it will be carried out with `requested_from` and `resquested_to`.

    ### Transfer Statuses

    ### requested
    Transfers created by accounts that can not manage all participating warehouses are created in the `requested` state and must be confirmed by a third-party warehouse administrator.

    ### confirmed
    Transfers created by accounts that can manage all the warehouses participating in the transfer are created in the `confirmed` state. In this state an outbound order is created if applicable. In addition, the in_coming stock of the variants is updated.

    ### received
    Transfer arrived at the arrival deposit. When an outbound order is completed, the good in goes to received.

    ### processing
    Transfer is `processing`.

    ### completed
    Transfer was `completed`. In each item the stock is updated if it´s a variant and it´s resumed if it´s an order.

    ### cancelled
    Only transfers that have not yet been confirmed can be `cancelled`.
    
    Check Ins
    ---------
    Check ins represents the receipt of an order in a warehouse.
    This receipt may be due to an undelivered shipment, a return
    or because the order will be available for pickup by a buyer.
    
    An order can only have one associated check in.
    
    ### Check Ins Statuses
    
    *  `created`: the order is being sent to the warehouse.
    Only un this status the scheduled_action is editable.
    *  `received`: the order has been received in the warehouse. The quality process will start soon.
    *  `processing`: the order is in the quality process.
    *  `completed`: the order check in is completed.
    
    ### Check Ins Actions
    
    A check in can have one associated action (the `scheduled_action`) that will be executed after
    quality process is completed successfully. Possible actions are as follows:
    *  `stock`: the items will be re-entered into stock.
    *  `resend`: the items will be resend to the buyer through a new order.
    *  `return`: the items will be returned to seller through a goods in.
    *  `pickup`: the order will be available in the warehouse for pickup by a buyer.
